# Rosetta Code Challenges

(via implementation on [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/rosetta-code/rosetta-code-challenges))

The Rosetta Code is a list of programming challenges which will help you build your programming skills.

"The idea is to present solutions to the same task in as many different languages as possible, to demonstrate how languages are similar and different, and to aid a person with a grounding in one approach to a problem in learning another." - Rosetta Code Homepage
